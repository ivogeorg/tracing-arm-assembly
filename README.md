# Tracing the Execution of an ARM Assembly Program

A short demo of tracing an ARM assembly program.

## 1. C Program Compiled to ARM Cortex-M0 Assembly

You can see both programs side by side in the convenient [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/FLnBlV), shown below for convenience.

## 2. Reading the ARM Instructions

A line-by-line reading of the instructions of the generated ARM code can be seen in the file [instruction-reading.md](instruction-reading.md).

## 3. Tracing the Program State
